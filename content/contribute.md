## üí∞ Financial support

The simplest and most favored way to help the project is to **contribute
financially** through one of these:
XXX TODO
- OpenCollective
- Patreon
- Github sponsors

## ü©∑ Visibility

A cheaper but still appreciated help is to **talk about the project on social
networks**. You can find us on the major ones (see footer); feel free to publicly
interact with us there.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development

If you are a developer, it is *highly encouraged* to [get in touch]({{< ref "/contact" >}})
with us before doing any significant development work to avoid any late
rejection or simply duplicated effort. That being said, the development happens
on [GitHub]({{< param github >}}), where you will find the following useful
resources:

- Code of conduct (XXX TODO)
- [Developer guidelines]({{< param github >}}/nope.gl/blob/main/doc/dev/ref/developers.md)
