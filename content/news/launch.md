We are officialy launching the Nope Foundry project today. Find us on social
networks (see footer) or come discuss with us on [Discord]({{< param discord >}}).

The project is still in early stage, but it is already usable for creating all
kind of content (check out the [Demos](/demos)!).

Our current focus includes extending the user documentation and examples as well
as providing a more accessible GUI for a better user experience.
